# hydrar
I'd like to make a hydrogen car that just about anyone can build at home. 
Why hydrogen? People like Elon Musk described the fuel cell as a "foolcell" because the energy loss is very high when converting 
electricity into hydrogen and then into mechanical energy. However, hydrogen offers advantages like faster charging, 
strictly speaking the "charging" time is as short as with a classic combustion engine like a diesel or gasoline engine, 
furthermore hydrogen cells offer advantages like easy recovery in case of an accident because hydrogen is lighter and therefore 
simply rises into the atmosphere and not like gasoline / diesel remains on the ground, possibly burning. This is also a little bit 
the third reason for a hydrogen car. Hydrogen is ten times lighter than air and thus has an energy density three times higher than 
Benin or diesel. So with one kilo of hydrogen you get three times further than with one kilo of petrol or diesel and yes hydrogen 
is produced with high consumption mainly from fossil fuels, but it is easier to switch to renewable energies because you only have 
to change the production of hydrogen and not also the consumers, so in our case the cars.

If something has done here, so if I see that this projekt is liked, I will invest a little bit more time. 
I have set up a discord server and when we reached something, I will make a website.
Ofcourse we need some structure, so "engineers". People how will build it together and people how make later or even now a software
to make it self driving.
